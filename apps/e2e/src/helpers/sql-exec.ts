/**
 * Run generated SQL against the live engine, and judge what came back.
 *
 * Database Access generates SQL for a DBA to copy and run by hand. Nothing in
 * the product ever executes it, so nothing in the product ever finds out
 * whether the engine would have accepted it — which is how three dialects came
 * to ship statements that cannot parse at all: `DROP USER` on Db2 (SQL0104N),
 * a host-qualified `CREATE ROLE` on MariaDB (ERROR 1064), and every account
 * statement on ClickHouse (the driver appended `FORMAT JSONEachRow` to DDL).
 * A preview-renders assertion passes on all three.
 *
 * So these tests execute the generated statements. The rule they apply is:
 *
 *   the engine may refuse us permission, but it must never refuse our syntax
 *
 * Permission and environment failures are expected and skipped — the E2E
 * Oracle account is a schema owner with no CREATE USER, and the CockroachDB
 * container runs insecure and rejects passwords outright. Those say nothing
 * about the SQL. Everything else fails the test, so an unrecognised error is
 * reported rather than tolerated.
