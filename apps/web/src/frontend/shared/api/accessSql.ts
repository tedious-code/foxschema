 * Running a generated GRANT / REVOKE script against a connection.

 * Dialect emitters return a script, not a statement: Postgres pairs USAGE ON
 * SCHEMA with ON ALL TABLES, Oracle follows CREATE USER with its quota grant.
 * The driver takes one statement per round-trip, so the script is split first.
 *
 * Split by `splitSqlStatements`, not a regex over `;`. Access scripts carry
 * quoted identifiers and passwords, and a `;` inside one is a semicolon, not a
 * separator — `GRANT SELECT ON "audit;2024" TO app` is one statement. The
 * shared splitter already tracks single quotes (including `''`), double
 * quotes, backticks, brackets and dollar-quoting, and terminates a statement
 * on `;` wherever it sits, so `GRANT a; GRANT b;` on one line splits in two.
