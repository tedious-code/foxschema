 * Connection settings — a facade over `@foxschema/sql`, like the rest of
 * `shared/lib/`.
 *
 * This file used to be the exception: 330 lines re-implementing the whole
 * 16-dialect registry, including each engine's `buildConnectionString`. The
 * duplication was described as accepted, to keep the browser from pulling in
 * the driver runtime — but that reason does not apply. `@foxschema/sql` is
 * dependency-free and Node-free by design (`purity.test.ts`), the frontend
 * already imports it everywhere, and this module was already delegating half
 * its dialects to it.
 *
 * What the copy cost, before it went:
 *
 * - `postgres.schemaRequired` disagreed with the canonical registry — the form
 *   marked Schema optional and saved, then `POST /schema/load` refused the
 *   connection because it reads the canonical value. Fixed in
 *   `packages/sql/src/providers/postgres/postgres.settings.ts`.
 * - the "adding a dialect" checklist carried a step for updating this file,
 *   which is exactly the kind of step that gets missed.
 *
 * `Dialect` and `isFileDialect` moved into `@foxschema/sql` so this could
 * become a pure re-export; the registry has one home again.
