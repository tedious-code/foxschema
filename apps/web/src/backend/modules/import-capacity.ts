 * How large a file this process can actually import, measured rather than
 * guessed, plus the numbers to explain the answer to a user.
 *
 * There are two independent ceilings, and a fixed constant can only ever be
 * right about one of them on one machine:
 *
 *  1. V8 caps a single string at ~512 MiB. The buffered import path reads the
 *     whole upload with readFileSync(path, 'utf8'), so a file past that cannot
 *     be read at all — it throws before any parsing starts.
 *  2. Parsing costs roughly ten times the file size in heap: the row matrix
 *     holds one JS string per cell, each with its own object header, where the
 *     file held bytes. Measured on CSV at 3.7 / 11.1 / 22.2 MB: 9.6x, 10.9x,
 *     8.4x.
 *
 * Which one binds depends on the host. A 512 MB container hits (2) at ~25 MB;
 * a 16 GB workstation hits (1) first. Reading the live heap means both get an
 * honest answer, and the warning can name the real number instead of a
 * hardcoded one that is wrong in both directions.
