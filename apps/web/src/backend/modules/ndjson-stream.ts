 * Incremental NDJSON reader — the JSON counterpart to CsvStreamReader. Feed it
 * decoded text a chunk at a time, take records out as whole lines complete.
 * Memory tracks the batch, not the file.
 *
 * Why this and not a JSON streaming library: NDJSON is one JSON value per
 * line, so the only thing that needs streaming is the line splitting, and
 * `JSON.parse` on a single record is already the fastest correct parser
 * available. A dependency would buy nothing here and add supply-chain surface
 * that CI scans on every build.
 *
 * Array-mode JSON (`[{…},{…}]`) is a different problem — a single value
 * spanning the whole file, which genuinely needs an incremental JSON parser to
 * stream. That is not solved here, deliberately; see the review notes on
 * stream-json.
 *
 * The grammar matches `parseJsonRecords` in ndjson mode exactly: same
 * blank-line skipping, same "each line must be a JSON object" rule, same
 * 1-based line numbers in errors. A streaming reader that diverged would
 * import different data — or accept different files — depending on size.
 *
 * There is deliberately no explicit byte-order-mark strip: every line is
 * trimmed, and `String.prototype.trim()` treats U+FEFF as whitespace. An
 * earlier version stripped it separately; removing that code changed no test,
 * which is how it was found to be dead.
