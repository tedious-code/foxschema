/**
 * Runs untrusted transform code on its own thread, with a deadline enforced by
 * killing the thread.
 *
 * `pipe.timeoutMs` bounds work that yields to the event loop, which covers a
 * stuck request or query. It cannot touch a synchronous busy loop: JavaScript
 * runs one thing at a time, so `while (true) {}` inside a pipe freezes the
 * event loop and *every other run on the instance* stops — timers included, so
 * the timeout that was supposed to save you never fires either. Nothing on that
 * thread can help. The only fix is for the code to be somewhere the host can
 * terminate.
 *
 * This is the execution path for code the engine did not write: plugin pipes
 * and user-authored expressions. Built-in pipes stay in-process — the boundary
 * costs a thread and a structured-clone per call, which is not worth paying to
 * protect the engine from itself.
 *
 * Contained, and pinned by `sandbox-containment.test.ts` against code that
 * escapes the scope via `Function('return require')()` — a guarantee that only
 * holds for a direct reference is worth nothing:
 *
 *  - **The filesystem.** Denied outright: the child starts under
 *    `--permission` with no `--allow-fs-*`, so a read fails with
 *    ERR_ACCESS_DENIED at the runtime level.
 *  - **Spawning a process.** Denied by the same mechanism.
 *  - **The host environment.** Started with `env: {}`, so `process.env` holds
 *    nothing of ours even with the real `process` in hand — the encryption key
 *    is not readable.
 *  - **Infinite loops** and **runaway allocation**: killed on the deadline, or
 *    the child hits its own heap cap and dies alone.
 *  - Network globals (`fetch`, `WebSocket`, …) are deleted and shadowed —
 *    the one capability the permission model does not cover.
 *
 * A *thread* could never achieve the first of those: Node grants a worker its
 * parent's filesystem access, so a worker can never be more restricted than
 * the engine that spawned it. Only a fresh process starts with nothing.
 *
 * The boundary costs ~12ms per call against a thread (28ms vs 16ms for 1,000
 * records). `isolation: 'thread'` remains available for code you would have
 * been willing to run in-process anyway, and its weaker guarantee is pinned by
 * a test rather than left to a comment.
