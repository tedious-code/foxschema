/**
 * Admission control for third-party pipe code.
 *
 * The capability layer stops a pipe reading another workflow's credentials, and
 * `pipe.timeoutMs` / `runSandboxed` stop one run freezing the instance. Neither
 * helps here: a plugin's module body runs at **import** time, before any pipe
 * executes and before any of those boundaries apply. `import` of untrusted code
 * is already game over, so the only defence is refusing to import it.
 *
 * So a plugin loads when, and only when, an operator has named it *and* the
 * bytes still match what they approved. Approving `acme-pipes` must not silently
 * approve whatever that directory contains tomorrow — a plugin directory is
 * exactly the kind of place where a supply-chain edit lands quietly.
