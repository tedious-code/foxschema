 * One handle over ten engines, for a project using this package as a library.
 *
 * Everything here already existed; what was missing was a seam that put it
 * together. A caller had to know three things — `ConnectionFactory.create`,
 * `getAdapter(dialect).query`, and that closing goes back through
 * `ConnectionFactory.close(dialect, conn)` with the same dialect string — and
 * carry the dialect through all three by hand. Getting that last pairing wrong
 * leaks a pooled connection, and nothing tells you.
 *
 * This changes no existing API. The migration/compare paths keep using the
 * factory directly; this is the front door for someone who only wants to run
 * queries against several engines with one shape of code.
