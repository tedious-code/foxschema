 * The error contract: one vocabulary for every failure the API reports.
 *
 * The server already had `ServiceErrorCode`, and it worked — but it was used at
 * one of 144 error sites, and even there the code never reached the client. The
 * response was `{ error: "..." }`: a status and a human sentence. A caller that
 * wants to tell "you are not signed in" from "your session expired", or to
 * retry only on a lock conflict, had nothing to branch on but prose. Message
 * text is for people; `code` is for programs, and the two change for different
 * reasons.
 *
 * The codes below are not aspirational — each maps to a status this API already
 * returns, counted across the route files:
 *
 *   400 × 68   invalid_input          409 × 5   conflict
 *   500 × 25   failed / internal      401 × 4   unauthenticated
 *   404 × 16   not_found              403 × 3   forbidden
 *   429 × 1    rate_limited           422 × 1   idempotency_mismatch
 *
 * Lives in `shared` rather than the server because the frontend is the party
 * that has to switch on it. A contract only one side can see is not a contract.
 */

/**
 * Every failure the API can report.
 *
 * Adding one is a wire change: clients may switch on these, so treat the list
 * the way you would treat a public enum. Prefer reusing a code over minting a
 * near-synonym — `code` answers "what should the caller do?", and two codes
 * that call for the same action should be one code with different messages.
