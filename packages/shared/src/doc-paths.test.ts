 * `CLAUDE.md` is loaded into every agent session; `AGENTS.md`, `README.md` and
 * `docs/CODE_MAP.md` are where a human starts. They are not prose — they are
 * the index. When the tree moves and the index does not, the index stops being
 * wrong in a way anyone notices and starts being wrong in a way everyone acts
 * on.
 *
 * That already happened once. The backend moved from `apps/web/src/backend/` to
 * `packages/server/src/` and Express was removed entirely, and for some months
 * afterwards `CLAUDE.md` still pointed the append-only-migration rule — the
 * data-loss-class rule in this repo — at a `schema.ts` that no longer existed,
 * while nine files still described a server that was gone.
 *
 * The same drift is checked for elsewhere and for the same reason: see
 * `naming.test.ts` (conventions), `purity.test.ts` (package boundaries) and
 * `TRIGGER_KINDS` in the workflow engine (a contract that was copied by hand
 * and drifted twice).
 *
 * Scope is deliberately the *navigational* docs only. Plan and release
 * documents are history — `docs/API_RESTRUCTURE_PLAN.md` says in its own header
 * that its paths are stale and kept as the record of why, which is a legitimate
 * thing for a document to be. Those are not scanned.
