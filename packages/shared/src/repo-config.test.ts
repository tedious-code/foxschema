 * The repo's own wiring, checked — because both bugs it covers were silent.
 *
 * Adding Turborepo, I gave each package `lint: eslint src` and pointed the root
 * `lint` script at `turbo lint`. That looked like a speedup and was a trap:
 * `eslint .` covers 904 files, the per-package sum covered 801. `npm run lint`
 * passed while CI — which runs `eslint .` in three workflows — still failed, on
 * apps/e2e, apps/cli's scripts and the root scripts. A local gate that checks
 * less than CI is worse than no local gate, because it is trusted.
 *
 * In the same change I listed `tsconfig.base.json` in `globalDependencies`. No
 * such file exists. Turbo hashes nothing for a missing entry, so the cache key
 * silently *narrowed* while the config claimed it had widened — the failure
 * mode being a stale cache hit, which is the one thing a build cache must never
 * do.
