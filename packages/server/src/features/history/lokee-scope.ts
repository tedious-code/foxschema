/**
 * Object types a Lokee capture reads.
 *
 * It lives here, next to the history feature that owns it, rather than being
 * exported from the composition root: `api/routes.ts` is where features are
 * assembled, and nothing under `features/` imports from it — exporting this
 * from there invited a `features → api` dependency that runs the wrong way.
 *
 * Two callers need the *same* list: the capture in `api/routes.ts`, and the
 * force-migrate routes, which read a target's live schema to diff a stored
 * version against it. A second copy would be free to drift, and drift here is
 * silent — a shorter list makes force-migrate diff against a schema missing its
 * views and functions, and the generated plan would quietly drop them.
 *
 * Curated, not derived: this is 8 of `DbObjectType`'s 9 members, omitting
 * `ROLE`, which is an account rather than a schema object.
