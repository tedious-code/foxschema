/**
 * Idempotency for the endpoints that change something.
 *
 * The dangerous case is a retry the caller did not intend: a dropped response,
 * a double-click, a proxy timeout, or an offline banner prompting someone to
 * press Run again. The request already reached the database — the *reply* is
 * what went missing — so retrying applies the migration or the GRANT twice.
 *
 * A caller supplies `Idempotency-Key` on a mutating request. The first one runs
 * and its response is remembered; a repeat with the same key returns that
 * remembered response instead of executing again.
 *
 * Two properties worth stating, because they are what make this safe rather
 * than merely convenient:
 *
 * - **In-flight requests are held, not waved through.** A duplicate arriving
 *   while the first is still running waits for it. Returning "in progress"
 *   would leave the caller to retry, which is the thing being prevented.
 * - **The key is bound to the request body.** Reusing a key with a different
 *   payload is a client bug, and replaying the old response would hide it. That
 *   is rejected loudly instead.
 *
 * Per-process and in-memory, like the rest of this app's middleware: it makes a
 * single server's retries safe. It is not a distributed transaction log.
