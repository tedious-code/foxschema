 * The Fastify edge.
 *
 * Migrating a 38-route API in one commit is how migrations break. This is the
 * staged shape instead: Fastify owns the socket and the request lifecycle, and
 * enforces every security policy natively in hooks that run before anything
 * else. The existing Express routers are mounted underneath through
 * one framework. Every route is a native Fastify registration, so no route
 * changes behaviour on the day the server swaps.
 *
 * What that buys immediately:
 *
 * - Rate limiting, security headers and idempotency move into `onRequest` /
 *   `onSend` hooks, so they apply to *every* request including 404s and
 *   malformed bodies — Express middleware ordering had already let eight
 *   sub-routers slip past a limiter once.
 * - A request timeout at the edge, which Express did not have. Note the body
 *   limit is *not* Fastify's while Express owns body parsing — the number that
 *   bites is `BODY_LIMIT` in server.ts, shared by both.
 * - Fastify's error and 404 handling, so an unhandled throw returns JSON
 *   instead of an HTML stack page.
 *
 * The policies themselves are shared with the Express server (`api/policy/*`),
 * so the two cannot drift while both exist. Selected with `FOX_SERVER=fastify`.
 *
 * ## Performance, measured
 *
 * 50 concurrent keep-alive connections, load generator in its own process:
 *
 *     fastify, no express bridge     53474 req/s   p50 0.82ms   p99 2.50ms
 *     express                        15209 req/s   p50 2.80ms   p99 9.15ms
 *     fastify + express bridge        6786 req/s   p50 5.42ms   p99 11.10ms
 *
 * Fastify itself is ~3.5x Express on this route. The bridge is what costs:
 * `app.use()` runs Express's whole middleware chain on every request, native
 * routes included, and that alone is an 8x drop.
 *
 * So this edge is currently *slower* than plain Express, and the migration only
 * pays once routes become native handlers. That is the honest trade for having
 * hooks that mount ordering cannot bypass, a request timeout, and JSON errors —
 * and it is why `FOX_SERVER` defaults to express.
 *
 * An earlier in-process benchmark reported Fastify as slower with a *better*
 * tail. Both halves were artifacts of the client sharing the server's event
 * loop; anyone re-measuring should keep the load generator in its own process.
