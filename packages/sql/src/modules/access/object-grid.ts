 * The object × privilege grid behind the permission builder.
 *
 * The flat builder asks for one permission set and one scope, so granting a
 * reader SELECT on four tables and EXECUTE on two procedures is four visits to
 * the form. This module models the whole answer at once: rows are objects,
 * columns are privileges, and a cell is a checkbox.
 *
 * Most of the file is the table saying which cells an engine can actually
 * express. That table is the point. A grid drawn without it looks uniform and
 * is not: `ALTER` on a named table is a privilege in MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle
 * and Db2, and in PostgreSQL it is ownership — there is no GRANT that confers
 * it. `DROP` is narrower still: only the MySQL family has it per object. A grid
 * that offers those cells everywhere generates SQL that fails on half the
 * engines it was drawn for, and the reader is told nothing until the database
 * refuses it.
 *
 * `CREATE` is absent from every object row on purpose. It cannot be granted on
 * a named object, because the object does not exist yet — it is a schema- or
 * database-scoped privilege, and it belongs to the scope selector rather than
 * to a row.
 *
 * Nothing here knows a GRANT keyword; it decides *what* is expressible and the
 * dialect emitters decide how to write it.
