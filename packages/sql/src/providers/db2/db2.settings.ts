 * The ibm_db release Fox installs and tells people to install.

 * Pinned exactly: ibm_db downloads IBM's clidriver at install time and builds a
 * native binding, and a floating range has broken that before. The package.json
 * entries (packages/db, apps/web) must match — `ibm-db-pin.test.ts` checks.
 * Changing the version means changing it here and there, nowhere else.
