 * Redis has no named namespaces. The adapter passes it to SELECT, so a
 * non-numeric value would be ignored rather than fail loudly; keeping it out
 * of the URL and validating it here is the honest place to catch that.
 *
 * `schemaRequired` is false because database 0 is the default and most
 * deployments never leave it.
