# Fox Schema 0.2.49 — What's new

> **For users:** this is the page the in-app update toast links to (**What's new**).

Covers everything since **`v0.2.36`**.

---

## What's new

### Compare & migrate data (side-by-side)

- **Compare data** across credentials with colored cell diffs.
- **Source on the left**, Target(s) on the right — clear Source → Target labels.
- **Key alignment** so rows pair by the keys you care about (not only row order).
  Keys fall back to shared result columns when the PK is not in the SELECT.
- **Keys picker** — choose which columns define a match; values follow.
- **Sync column** on the destination grid (on by default) — uncheck rows to skip.
- **Sync all** + **Migrate** respect op filters ∩ your Sync checkboxes (≤500 ops).
  Unchecking Add / Edit / Delete clears the matching Sync rows.
- **Sync scroll** (default on) keeps vertical scroll and hover aligned across **all**
  compare grids; turn it off to scroll independently.
- **CSV all** downloads every compare grid in **one** CSV (`Source.col` / `Target.col`,
  plus `op` / `key` when key-aligned).
- **Maximize** opens Compare fullscreen for more grid space (Close / Esc).
- Insert / delete rows tint **both** grids (including name-only keys).

### SQL Editor

- Edit data in query result grids (add / edit / clone / delete) when the PK is present.
- Schema explorer pinned at the top of the sidebar.
- `@faker-js/faker` allowed in code cells.
- Column picker alias fix + validated Data Peek row form.
- Safer code-cell queries and Peek integer handling; Safe Mode skips INSERT.

### Access & migrate correctness

- RBAC enforced on Data grid writes.
- Data migrate key / identity / auth fixes.

### Ports & process

- Default API / Docker port is now **3210** (same as the CLI), away from the busy
  **3000/3001** band. Override with `PORT` / `API_PORT` / `foxschema open --port`.
- CLI **`foxschema open`** auto-picks the next free port (3211+) when 3210 is taken
  by another app (unless you pass an explicit `--port`).
- UI / API process title is **`foxschema`** so it is easy to find in Activity Monitor /
  Task Manager.

## How to update (no terminal required)

If you installed with **npm** and open Fox Schema via **`foxschema`** / **`foxschema open`**:

1. When a newer version is on npm, the UI shows an **Update available** toast
   (also under the profile menu and **User Preference**).
2. Click **What's new** to open this release page.
3. Click **Update now** — Fox Schema runs `npm install -g foxschema@latest` for you,
   restarts the UI on the same port, and reloads the browser tab.  
   You do **not** need to open a terminal or type the command yourself.

| Where you see it | What to click |
|------------------|---------------|
| Boot toast | **Update now** (or **What's new**) |
| Profile menu | **Update available · v…** → release page; open Preferences for the button |
| User Preference → Updates | **Update now** |

**Update now** is available when:

- You run the local CLI UI (`foxschema open` sets self-update on), and
- You are **not** in Docker / a locked-down multi-user server.

If **Update now** is hidden, use **Copy command** and paste into a terminal, or
upgrade your channel below.

### Other install channels

| You installed with | Upgrade with |
|--------------------|--------------|
| **npm** (CLI) | Prefer **Update now** in the UI; or `npm install -g foxschema@latest` |
| **Homebrew** | `brew update && brew upgrade foxschema` |
| **Docker** | `docker pull 5nickels/foxschema:latest` then recreate the container |

Keep your data volume / encryption key stable so saved connections stay readable.
Then: `foxschema stop && foxschema open` (or reopen Docker) and optionally
`foxschema doctor`.

# Fox Schema 0.2.50 — Hotfix

Empty / Cannot GET / page after install when an API-only process owns port 3210.
### What's fixed

foxschema detects when /api/health is up but the UI shell is missing, and restarts instead of saying “already running.”
foxschema stop also stops unmanaged listeners on the UI port (orphans with no PID lock).
How to update

```bash
npm install -g foxschema@0.2.50
```
### free a stuck 3210 if needed, then:
```bash

foxschema stop
foxschema
Or: brew update && brew upgrade foxschema
```
