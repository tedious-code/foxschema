/**
 * Security-only lint pass. `npm run lint:security`.
 *
 * The main config (`eslint.config.js`) carries the security rules *and* code
 * quality rules, and quality findings are warnings — a deliberate choice, since
 * blindly satisfying `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` can change behaviour and each
 * site needs a human. That left `lint:security` (`eslint . --max-warnings 0`)
 * unable to pass: it counted those advisories too, sat at 230 warnings, and CI
 * quietly ran plain `eslint .` instead. `docs/security/security-process.md` has
 * described it as "zero warnings (same as CI)" the whole time. None of that was
 * true.
 *
 * This config exists so the claim can be. It runs the security rules and
 * nothing else, at zero tolerance, over the same files. A finding here is a
 * security finding, and the run is green or it is not.
 *
 * The rules are intentionally duplicated from `eslint.config.js` rather than
 * imported from it: that file's shape (parser blocks, per-area overrides) is
 * about quality as much as security, and coupling the two means a quality
 * refactor can silently change what the security gate covers.
 * `security-config-parity.test.ts` checks the two lists have not drifted.
