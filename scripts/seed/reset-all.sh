# FoxSchema — full reset: bring up every dialect container, wait for them to
# actually be healthy, restart the local dev server (releases pooled DB
# connections that can block Oracle/DB2 DROP USER on reseed), then truncate +
# reseed every dialect via seed-all.sh.
#
# This exists because running `bash scripts/seed/seed-all.sh all` against a
# container that's still starting, or while the dev server holds a pooled
# connection open, produces confusing partial failures that look like app
# bugs but are actually environment races — burned real debugging time on
# both of these more than once. See "False leads" in
# docs/plans/2026-07-01-migration-ordering-bugs.md.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/seed/reset-all.sh                  # full reset (default)
#   bash scripts/seed/reset-all.sh --no-restart-dev  # skip the dev-server bounce
#   bash scripts/seed/reset-all.sh --no-up           # don't touch docker compose,
#                                                     # just wait+reseed what's running
#
# Safe to re-run any time — every step here is idempotent (docker compose up
# is a no-op for already-running containers; each dialect's seed script does
# its own DROP+CREATE before reseeding).
